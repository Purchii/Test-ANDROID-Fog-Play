Production safety classification: `PROD_SAFE_OFFLINE_STATIC_AND_SYNTHETIC_ONLY`

## Goal

Implement synthetic/local-only API-layer redaction and production-safety guard
tests for the audit chain. TASK-033 validates tracked TASK-028/TASK-036 public
summary counts and a fabricated synthetic guard ledger, then emits a public-safe
report containing only aliases, counts, categories, status values and blockers.

## Forbidden Actions

`PROD_FORBIDDEN`:

- live REST/backend/API calls;
- live STOMP/WebSocket handshakes, subscriptions, sends or publishes;
- live WebRTC/DataChannel handshakes, sends or receives;
- live gamepad/controller input, pairing, HID or Android input injection;
- Android runtime, ADB, APK read/hash/install/launch or modification;
- reading ignored local API quarantine pack raw values for TASK-033;
- auth/session/token/header/cookie replay;
- endpoint discovery/publication or executable API recipes;
- network capture/proxying;
- payment, order, profile, account, device binding or session mutation;
- stream/session start;
- QR target traversal;
- TLS/pinning/security bypass;
- printing or committing raw endpoints, URLs, headers, payloads, fixture
  bodies, cookies, tokens, QR targets, device identifiers, local paths, secrets,
  account/payment/session values, protocol payload bodies, gamepad mapping
  values or real user data.

## Current Status

Implementation and local verification are complete on the task branch.

Implementation status:

- fresh thread, title and goal verified;
- task branch created from `origin/main@3e284b225bea42a45848cc9748dfab541f947ffd`;
- task spec added;
- validator added at
  `automation/api_layer_contract/validate_task033_api_redaction_prod_safety_guards.py`;
- focused tests added at
  `tests/test_task033_api_redaction_prod_safety_guards.py`;
- public-safe report generated at
  `docs/qa/reports/task033_api_redaction_prod_safety_guards.summary.json`;
- current local report status is `pass`: 10 fabricated synthetic guard cases,
  zero live budget, zero raw public specimens and TASK-028/TASK-036 source
  reconciliation confirming 8 known security/redaction rows;
- focused TASK-033 tests currently pass with 26 tests;
- targeted API-chain tests through TASK-037 and full pytest currently pass;
- live/backend/network/runtime/Android/WebRTC/gamepad/payment/session
  execution statuses remain `not_run`.

## Multi-agent Status

- Orchestrator: current thread; source-of-truth read, TASK-033 selected,
  thread renamed, goal and branch created, implementation coordinated.
- Planner: approved TASK-033 selection with `GO`.
- Security/Prod-safety initial reviewer: approved TASK-033 static/synthetic
  plan with `GO`; identified false-pass cases around raw nested values,
  live/runtime overclaims, pass-with-blockers and budget drift.
- Builder: implemented the core synthetic/offline validator and focused tests;
  Orchestrator added TASK-028/TASK-036 source reconciliation on top.
- QA Reviewer A: initially found nested unknown-field and external-specimen
  projection false-pass risks; remediation added strict nested allowlists and
  external-specimen pre-projection checks; re-review approved.
- QA Reviewer B: initially found nested unknown-field false-pass risk;
  remediation added strict nested allowlists; re-review approved.
- Security/Prod-safety final pass: initially found nested unknown-field and
  hidden live/runtime overclaim false-pass risk; remediation added strict
  nested allowlists; re-review approved.
- Docs/Scribe: initially found stale TASK-032 lifecycle wording in
  source-of-truth docs; remediation recorded TASK-032 integration to
  `main@3e284b2`; re-review approved.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Fresh TASK-033 thread, goal and branch are verified.
- Public-safe task spec, report, validator and tests exist.
- Validator reconciles TASK-028/TASK-036 tracked public summaries for 8 known
  API-layer security/redaction rows.
- Embedded fabricated synthetic guard suite produces a `pass` report.
- Optional missing synthetic specimen file produces controlled
  `partial_blocked`, and CLI exits nonzero by default unless an explicit
  partial-blocker flag is used.
- Public report contains only aliases, counts, categories, status values and
  blockers.
- Runtime/live/network/API/Android/WebRTC/gamepad/payment/session statuses
  remain `not_run`.
- QA A, QA B, Security/Prod-safety and Docs/Scribe reviews complete without
  unresolved R0/R1 blockers.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report a blocker if:

- implementation requires live API/backend/network/runtime/ADB/APK execution;
- implementation requires reading or publishing raw API pack material;
- public output would include raw endpoints, URLs, headers, payloads, fixture
  bodies, tokens, cookies, QR targets, device/account/payment/session values,
  local paths, protocol payload bodies or gamepad mapping values;
- TASK-028/TASK-036 public summary reconciliation fails and cannot be fixed
  inside TASK-033 scope;
- tests fail and cannot be fixed inside TASK-033 scope;
- QA or Security review reports unresolved R0/R1 risk.
