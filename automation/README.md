# Automation

This directory contains public-safe local QA tooling for the Android TV QA repository.

## Runtime Smoke Bootstrap

`automation/runtime_smoke_bootstrap/` contains the TASK-001 blocked-report generator. It is a local dry-run utility and does not interact with an Android device, app binary, network service or production environment.

The generator is designed to fail closed:

- missing approved build metadata -> `blocked`;
- missing approved target metadata -> `blocked`;
- missing approved configuration metadata -> `blocked`;
- complete metadata still does not execute runtime checks in TASK-001.

## Safety Rules

Automation in this repository must not request or store:

- source or decompiled application code;
- secrets, tokens, cookies, sessions or credentials;
- private endpoint inventories;
- APK, AAB, DEX, native or signing artifacts;
- raw logs, screenshots or videos;
- real user data or real payment data.

Runtime/device execution belongs to a future approved task after prerequisites, redaction and review gates are satisfied.
